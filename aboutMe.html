				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I am a junior at the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/">Universtiy of Rochester</a> studying <a href="http://cs.rochester.edu/">Computer Science</a> with a minor in History. I've taken classes in Physics, Astronomy, Writing, and Philosophy in addition to my major requirements in Computer Science and Math. I also have proficient skills in reading and writing Italian and experience with verbal Italian.<br>I am a brother in the ΔΧ-Delta Chi chapter of ΦΚΤ-Phi Kappa Tau Fraternity at the University of Rochester and am currently serving as the IFC (Inter-Fraternity Council) Representative for my chapter.</p>
				<p>I will be leading a workshop section for CSC 171 - Intro to Computer Science course being taught by Professor Pawlicki. I will lead small workshops of students in learning course materials, solidifying concepts, and working through problems outside of the lecture hall.</p>
				<p>In addition to the skills listed on the home page, through my coursework I have worked with MIPS Assembly as well as Racket and functional programming through my coursework.</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout in Devon Troop 50, BSA and have attained the Vigil Honor in <a href="http://octoraro22.org/">Octoraro Lodge #22</a>, Order of the Arrow (OA), BSA. I served in many leadership positions in Devon 50, my final position before aging out at 18 was Assistant Senior Patrol Leader. In the Order of the Arrow I performed on the ceremonies team, I served as a chairman of several committees, and was elected to serve as the lodge Treasurer for the 2014 term.</p>
				<p>The past three summers I have worked at the Boy Scout camp I have attended since 5th grade. The first two summers I worked as OA Camp Chief, coordinating the OA program at <a href="http://www.cccbsa.org/boy-scout-camp-horseshoe">Camp Horseshoe</a> and its partner Cub Scout camp across the river, Camp Ware. This past summer I worked as the Archery Director for Camp Horseshoe.</p>
				<p>My high school, <a href="http://www.tesd.net/stoga">Conestoga High School</a> in Berwyn, PA, has a program for seniors to intern at a business for the last month of school. During this program we meet with school faculty advisors and our sponsors onsite at the business to discuss what we are learning. I interned at <a href="http://www.pietragallo.com/">Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick &amp; Raspanti, LLP</a>. I worked under the guidance of <a href="http://www.pietragallo.com/attorneys.php?action=view&id=48">Mr. Douglas K. Rosenblum, Esq.</a> I assisted with the general office work and the  case work.</p>
				<p>From March 2013 until I had to leave for universtiy I was a peer mentor in the Friend Fitness program of the <a href="http://youthmp.org/">Youth Mentoring Partnership</a> in Great Valley, PA. The program helped youth learn goal-setting, determination, self-worth, and 'grit' through fitness.</p>
