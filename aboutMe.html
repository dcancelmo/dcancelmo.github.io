				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a rising senior at the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/">University of Rochester</a> studying <a href="http://cs.rochester.edu/">Computer Science</a> with a minor in History. I have a <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/CCAS/undergraduate/curriculum/clusters.html">cluster</a> in Art History and I've taken classes in Physics, Astronomy, Writing, and Philosophy in addition to my major requirements in Computer Science and Math. I also have proficient skills in reading and writing Italian and experience with verbal Italian.</p>
				<p>I am a brother in the ΔΧ (Delta Chi) chapter of ΦΚΤ (Phi Kappa Tau) Fraternity at the University of Rochester and am currently serving as the Vice President of Programming and the House Manager; I served as the Philanthropy Chairman for the Spring of 2018, the Housing Retention Manager during the 2018-2019 school year and the IFC (Inter-Fraternity Council) Representative for my chapter in the Fall of 2017.</p>
				<p>I was a Workshop Leader (Fall 2017) for the CSC 171 - Intro to Computer Science course taught by Professor Pawlicki. I led small workshops of students in learning course materials, solidifying concepts, and working through problems outside of the lecture hall.</p>
				<p>I was a Teaching Assistant (Spring 2018) for the CSC 214 - Android Mobile App Development course taught by Professor Root. Responsibilities were similiar to CSC 171.</p>
				<p>I will be a Teaching Assistant (Fall 2018) for CSC 170 - Web Design &amp; Development taught by Professor Kostin.</p>
				<p>In addition to the skills listed on the home page, through my coursework I have worked with MIPS Assembly as well as Racket and functional programming for school projects in the past.</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout in Devon Troop 50, BSA and have attained the Vigil Honor in <a href="http://octoraro22.org/">Octoraro Lodge #22</a>, Order of the Arrow (OA), BSA. I served in many leadership positions in Devon 50, my final position before aging out at 18 was Assistant Senior Patrol Leader. In the Order of the Arrow I performed on the ceremonies team, I served as a chairman of several committees, and was elected to serve as the lodge Treasurer for the 2014 term.</p>
				<p>The past three summers I have worked at the Boy Scout camp I have attended since 5th grade. The first two summers I worked as OA Camp Chief, coordinating the OA program at <a href="http://www.cccbsa.org/boy-scout-camp-horseshoe">Camp Horseshoe</a> and its partner Cub Scout camp across the river, Camp Ware. This past summer I worked as the Archery Director for Camp Horseshoe.</p>
				<p>My high school, <a href="http://www.tesd.net/stoga">Conestoga High School</a> in Berwyn, PA, has a program for seniors to intern at a business for the last month of school. During this program we meet with a school faculty advisor and our sponsors onsite at the business to discuss what we are learning. I interned at <a href="http://www.pietragallo.com/">Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick &amp; Raspanti, LLP</a>. I worked under the guidance of <a href="http://www.pietragallo.com/attorneys.php?action=view&id=48">Mr. Douglas K. Rosenblum, Esq.</a> I assisted with the general office work and the case work.</p>
				<p>From March 2013 until I had to leave for university I was a peer mentor in the Friend Fitness program of the <a href="http://youthmp.org/">Youth Mentoring Partnership</a> in Great Valley, PA. The program helped youth learn goal-setting, determination, self-worth, and 'grit' through fitness.</p>
