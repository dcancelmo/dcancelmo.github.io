				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I am a sophomore at the Universtiy of Rochester studying Computer Science with a minor in History. I've taken classes in Physics, Astronomy, Writing, and Philosophy in addition to my major requirements in Computer Science and Math. I also have proficient skills in reading and writing Italian and experience with verbal Italian.</p>
				<p>I am an Eagle Scout in Devon Troop 50, BSA and have attained the Vigil Honor in Octoraro Lodge #22, Order of the Arrow (OA), BSA.</p>
				<p>The past three summers I have worked at the Boy Scout camp I have attended since 5th grade. The first two summers I worked as OA Camp Chief, coordinating the OA program at Camp Horseshoe and its partner Cub Scout camp across the river, Camp Ware. This past summer I worked as the Archery Director for Camp Horseshoe.</p>
				<p>My high school, Conestoga High School in Berwyn, PA, has a program for seniors to intern at a business for the last month of school. During this program we meet with school faculty advisors and our sponsors onsite at the business to discuss what we are learning. I interned at Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick &amp; Raspanti, LLP. I worked under the guidance of Mr. Douglas K. Rosenblum, Esq. I assisted with the general office work and the  case work.</p>
