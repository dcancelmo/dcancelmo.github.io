				<h2>How I came to study Computer Science</h2>
				<p>When I first started looking at schools I wanted to be a Genetic Engineer. When I entered my senior year and I started applying to universities I applied as a Philosophy Major planning on doing pre-law and a possible History double-major with an end goal of being a judge. During the Summer between the end of high school and the beginning of college, I decided I wanted to study Astrophysics. I was a Physics and Astronomy major for my first semester. I realized it was not for me and decided to give Computer Science a try. I fell in love with programing and remained in the major. I maintained my interest in History however and have completed the requirements for my History minor. Mobile (Android) App Development continues to be my favorite Computer Science course, it instilled in me a great passion for mobile development. Bringing applications into one's daily life by making it more accessible via handheld devices is vitally important to me.</p>
