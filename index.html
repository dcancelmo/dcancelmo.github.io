				<h2>How I came to study Computer Science</h2>
				<p>When I first started looking at schools I wanted to be a Genetic Engineer. When I entered my senior year and I started applying to universities I applied as a Philosophy Major planning on doing pre-law and a possible History double-major with an end goal of being a judge. During the Summer between the end of high school and the beginning of college, I decided I wanted to study Astrophysics. I was a Physics and Astronomy major for my first semester. I realized it was not for me and decided to give Computer Science a try. I fell in love with programing and remained in the major. I maintained my interest in History however and did in fact double major in it. Mobile (Android) App Development was my favorite Computer Science course, it instilled in me a great passion for mobile development.</p>
